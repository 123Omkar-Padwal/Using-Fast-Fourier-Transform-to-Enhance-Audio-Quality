# Using Fourier Transform to Improve the Voice Quality of a Recording 

# Task
Use the Fourier transform to modify the audio signals with the goal of increasing the voice quality. Using the audio you must determine the region of the highest
harmonic voice frequencies in the spectrum and increase the amplitudes of those frequencies with the help of the Fourier Transform

# Data Acquisation
Recorded the voice of one member of the group as an uncompressed WAV file. 

Following recording specification were followed:

1]Recording must be based on the voice of one member of the team

2]Recoding should be of one complete sentence in any language

3]Recording must be uncompressed WAV file

4]Recording must be of a sampling Rate of 44kHz or higher

5]Recording must be audio must not exhibit clipping

6]Recording must contain the full audio spectrum up to 20kHz
